**This is a guide** on how to connect RStudio with Git with GitHub, in case the RStudio project existed first.  
Our goal is to:  
`r fa("registered", fill="#383e42", width="50px", margin_right="10px")` 
`r fa("left-right", fill="#383e42", width="50px", margin_right="10px")` 
`r fa("git-alt", fill="#383e42", width="50px", margin_right="10px")` 
`r fa("left-right", fill="#383e42", width="50px", margin_right="10px")` 
`r fa("github", fill="#383e42", width="50px")`

Inspired by and copied a lot from [Aaron Peikert's "Repro workshop"](https://aaronpeikert.github.io/repro-workshop/self-paced/).

# Create an RStudio project `r fa("registered", fill="#383e42")`
**(if you haven't already)**

* If you can, check the boxes for "Create a git repository" and "Use renv with this project"  
* If you can't or you already created the RStudio project: No matter, It'll work anyway.

# Connect to Git `r fa("registered", fill="#383e42", margin_right="10px")` `r fa("left-right", fill="#383e42", margin_right="10px")` `r fa("git-alt", fill="#383e42", margin_right="10px")`

You haven't **installed** [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer? Now is a good time. You don't need admin rights to do this.

Now we'll tell git who we are.  
Do this once for *each project*.  

## `usethis` package

The `usethis` package will help us a lot. Install it:

```{r}
install.packages("usethis")
```

## Let Git know who you are 

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Via `usethis`
```{r}
usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Jane Doe", # <-- change to your name
  user.email = "jane@example.org", # <-- and your email
  init.defaultBranch = "main") # <-- not necessary but kinder than 'master'
```

### Alternative via terminal

Click on the `Terminal` tab (right next to the `Console` tab).  
Give your user name and email.

```
git config user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config user.email "mona@lisa.org"
```

:::

## Initiate Git

If you haven't checked the box "Create a git repository", when creating the new project, run this code to start using Git.

```{r}
usethis::use_git()
```


\
\

# Connect to GitHub `r fa("registered", fill="#383e42", margin_right="10px")` `r fa("left-right", fill="#383e42", margin_right="10px")` `r fa("git-alt", fill="#383e42", margin_right="10px")` `r fa("github", fill="#383e42")`


**Do you have a GitHub account?**

* **Yes**: Well done. Go to the first step
* **No**: Now would be a good time to make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

  
## Verify that it is you

Not just anyone should be able to edit your repository, just you. So obviously you'll need to identify to GitHub. This is usually done by creating a *personal access token (PAT)*.  
  
### Create GitHub PAT
*You have used a PAT with RStudio on this machine before?*  
Then you probably don't need to do this step. Jump to the last step "Create GitHub repo".

```{r}
usethis::create_github_token(description = "Token for project ...") # <-- Fill in a name of your token
```

* Log into GitHub
* Set `expiration date` to `No expiration` (or a certain time frame if that's too insecure for you or there are more people using RStudio on this machine)
* Additionally check `write:packages`
* Create PAT
* Copy PAT and paste it somewhere for later use. *You cannot look it up in GitHub!*

### Now set this PAT in your RStudio
to make GitHub know: It is you who is using RStudio on this machine.

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Via `credentials`

I think the `credentials` package might already be installed, if not, run this:

```{r}
install.packages("credentials")
```

And now set the PAT, to identify yourself.

```{r}
credentials::set_github_pat() # <-- Token must *not* go into brackets, paste when asked in popup
```


### Via `gitcreds`

We'll need the package `gitcreds`. Install it:

```{r}
install.packages("gitcreds")
```

And now set the PAT, to identify yourself.

```{r}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set() # <-- Token must *not* go into brackets, paste when asked in popup
```
:::

\

## Create GitHub repo

In this final step, you'll let RStudio create the GitHub repo for you.

```{r}
usethis::use_github()
```
